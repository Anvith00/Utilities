# A system that works for, not against you

Privacy: Requires no activation, no IDs, no accounts. Does not spy on you. Blocks tracking and ads by default. Comes with peer-to-peer technology built in, e.g., for receiving Remote Assistance.

Freedom: Lets you load software without restrictions. No signatures, sandboxes, notarizations. Makes it easy to modify applications. No hardware vendor lock-in. Designed to run on machines that are no longer supported by their manufacturer with operating system updates.

Security: Builds in end-to-end encryption where possible. Has full source code available for verification.

# That's it

Have fun exploring the system. Please keep in mind that this is a pre-release version intended mainly for developers and testers.

We would love to hear from you.
