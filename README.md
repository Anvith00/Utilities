# Utilities

Utilities written for FreeBSD in PyQt5, meant for use with GNUstep (but possibly eventually also [hello](https://github.com/probonopd/hello/)).

This is a work in progress.

* No compilation needed, since PyQt5
* Focus on simplicity for the user
* Focus on simplicity in source code
* One Python source code file per app
* Tested on FreeBSD in GWorkspace.app

Pull requests welcome.
