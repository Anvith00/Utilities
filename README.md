# Utilities

Utilities written for FreeBSD in PyQt5, meant for use with GNUstep (but possibly eventually also [hello](https://github.com/probonopd/hello/)).

This is a work in progress.

* One Python source code file per app
* Tested on FreeBSD in GWorkspace.app
* To the user, at least(!) as simple as the Mac counterpart

Pull requests welcome.

## Keyboard.app

Simple Keyboard Layout chooser

## Zeroconf.app
